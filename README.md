# Minimax and Reinforcement Learning in Board Games

This assignment explores the implementation of Minimax and Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms in classic board games: TicTacToe and Connect4. 

Utilizing the open source [python-tictactoe library](https://pypi.org/project/python-tictactoe/), this endeavor demonstrates the application of these algorithms in game strategy development.

```
Requirements: 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If encountering issues with `requirements.txt`, install the `python-tictactoe` library directly.

```bash
pip install python-tictactoe
```

### Running the Games Command
1. Run the t3.py file for Tic Tac Toe
2. Run the c4.py file for Connect 4

## Game Settings

### Default Settings for TicTacToe
- **ROWS**: 3
- **COLS**: 3

### Default Settings for Connect4
- **ROWS**: 6
- **COLS**: 7

## Algorithms and Players for both the games

- `DefaultPlayer`
- `MinimaxPlayer (with and without Alpha-Beta Pruning)`
- `QLearningPlayer`
